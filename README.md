MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, covering the entire range from personal projects and websites, via e-commerce and information services, all the way to high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

## Usage

```
docker create \
--name=mysql \
-p 3306:3306 \
-e PUID=<UID> \
-e PGID=<GID> \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<DATABASE PASSWORD> \
-v </path/to/appdata>:/config \
linuxserver/mysql
```

## Parameters

`The parameters are split into two halves, separated by a colon, the left hand side representing the host and the right the container side. 
For example with a port -p external:internal - what this shows is the port mapping from internal to external of the container.
So -p 8080:80 would expose port 80 from inside the container to be accessible from the host's IP on port 8080
http://192.168.x.x:8080 would show you what's running INSIDE the container on port 80.`


* `-p 3306` - mysql port
* `-v /config` - Contains the db itself and all assorted settings. 
* `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` - set this to root password for installation (minimum 4 characters)
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on phusion-baseimage with ssh removed, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it mysql /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application 

If you didn't set a password during installation, (see logs for warning) use mysqladmin -u root password <PASSWORD> to set one at the docker prompt... NOTE changing the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD variable after the container has set up the initial databases has no effect. It is also advisable to edit the run command or template/webui after setup and remove reference to this variable.

Find custom.cnf in /config for config changes (restart container for them to take effect) , the databases in /config/databases and the log in /config/log/myqsl.

The container also has mysqltuner included which can either be run from within the container by exec'ing in or externally by issuing `docker exec -it mysql mysqltuner`. It will prompt for credentials if you have set a password for root user.


## Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it mysql /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f mysql`

* container version number 

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' mysql`

* image version number

`docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "build_version" }}' linuxserver/mysql`

## Versions
