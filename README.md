MySQL is the world's most popular open source database. With its proven performance, reliability and ease-of-use, MySQL has become the leading database choice for web-based applications, covering the entire range from personal projects and websites, via e-commerce and information services, all the way to high profile web properties including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Yahoo! and many more.

## Usage

```
docker create \
--name=mysql \
-p 3306:3306 \
-e PUID=<UID> \
-e PGID=<GID> \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<DATABASE PASSWORD> \
-v </path/to/appdata>:/config \
linuxserver/mysql
```

**Parameters**

* `-p 3306` - mysql port
* `-v /config` - Contains the db itself and all assorted settings. 
* `-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` - set this to root password for installation (minimum 4 characters)
* `-e PGID` for GroupID - see below for explanation
* `-e PUID` for UserID - see below for explanation

It is based on phusion-baseimage with ssh removed, for shell access whilst the container is running do `docker exec -it mysql /bin/bash`.

### User / Group Identifiers

Sometimes when using data volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container. We avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`. Ensure the data volume directory on the host is owned by the same user you specify and it will "just work" â„¢.

In this instance `PUID=1001` and `PGID=1001`. To find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id <dockeruser>
    uid=1001(dockeruser) gid=1001(dockergroup) groups=1001(dockergroup)
```

## Setting up the application 

If you didn't set a password during installation, (see logs for warning) use mysqladmin -u root password <PASSWORD> to set one at the docker prompt... NOTE changing the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD variable after the container has set up the initial databases has no effect. It is also advisable to edit the run command or template/webui after setup and remove reference to this variable.

Find custom.cnf in /config for config changes (restart container for them to take effect) , the databases in /config/databases and the log in /config/log/myqsl.

The container also has mysqltuner included which can either be run from within the container by exec'ing in or externally by issuing `docker exec -it mysql mysqltuner`. It will prompt for credentials if you have set a password for root user.


## Info

* Shell access whilst the container is running: `docker exec -it mysql /bin/bash`
* To monitor the logs of the container in realtime: `docker logs -f mysql`


## Versions

+ **14.09.16:** Bump version due to USN-3078-1.
